# Pac-Man-projects
The Pac-Man projects teach foundational AI concepts. The projects allow you to visualize the results of the techniques you implement. Pac-Man provides a challenging problem environment that demands creative solutions.

# Project 1
In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently.
I have built general search algorithms that apply to Pacman scenarios.


The files i edited are search.py and searchAgents.py.

Vizualize Algorithms

Q1: Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Depth First Search
    command: python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent


# Project 2
In this project, i have designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts.
Along the way, i implemented both minimax, expectimax search and evaluation functions.


The files i edited are multiAgents.py and pacman.py.
